#The last exercise in this chapter is the first part of the 
#econd multi-part assignment of this course, the notebook. 
#In this notebook the user is able to add, read and delete 
#notes from a separate note file "notebook.txt".


#Create a program which allows the user to
#(1) Read the contents of the notebook
#(2) Add notes to the file or
#(3) Delete all of the notes.
#If the user selects 1, the entire notebook file is 
#printed to the screen, if 2 then the program prompts 
#"Write a new note: ", and adds the written note as 
#the last line into the file with a trailing line break "\n".
#If the player selects 3, the file is emptied and the 
#message "Notes deleted" will be shown. 
#Also add the option (4) Quit, which ends the program, 
#printing "Notebook shutting down, thank you.". 
#With other selections the program prompts "Incorrect selection".
