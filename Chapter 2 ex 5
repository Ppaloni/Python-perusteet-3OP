#In this exercise, the objective is to try taking input for 
#the first time. The idea is to create a simple program 
#which takes two numbers and perfoms an addition. 

print("Calculator")
input1 = input("Give the first number: ")
input2 = input("Give the second number: ")
input1 = int(input1)
input2 = int(input2)
sum = input1 + input2
print("The result is: ", sum)
