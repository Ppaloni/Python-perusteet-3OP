#In this program the objective is to understand how the 
#layout-characters (\t and \n} and print in general works. 
#By using only the print command, make the interpreter to 
#print out the following text:

firstline="This here is divided to several lines:\n"
secondline="I am still in the same print-command.\n"
name = "Name:	Peter\n"
job = "Job: 	Babysitter"

print(firstline,secondline,name,job)
