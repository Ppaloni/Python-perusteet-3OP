#Unsurprisingly, the second exercise in this chapter 
#discusses the task of writing to a file. 
#Create a program which prompts the user for a file name 
#"Give a file name: " and then for an input "Write something: ". 
#After this, the program writes the string given by the user to the 
#file and reports "Wrote [input] to the file [name].".


file = str(input("Give a file name: "))
myfile = open(file, "w")
mytext = str(input("Write something: "))
print("Wrote", mytext, "to the file ", file)
myfile.write(mytext)
myfile.close()
