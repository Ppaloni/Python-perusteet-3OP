##The first exercise in this chapter is an easy warm-up 
##exercise to get things rolling. 
##The objective is to create a variable by giving it the correct name,
##and assign it the string "string-type content" as a value. 
##Then insert this variable into a print command so that the 
##program prints out following text:

string = "Our variable has a value which is string-type content. Isn't that nice?"
print(string)
