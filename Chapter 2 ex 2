#The second exercise continues with the basics of using 
#variables. In this exercise, define two variables and 
#assign them values of 1000 and 24. After this, 
#make the interpreter do the calculation number1+number2+15 and 
#then take the 2nd exponent (**2) of the result. 
#Save this final result to a new variable, and make the 
#program print the result in the following way:

number1 = 1000
number2 =  24
sum = number1 + number2 + 15
finalresult = sum **2
print("The final results of the calculation was: ", finalresult)
