#The last exercise in this chapter focuses on string slices.
#Define a variable and assign it a string "desserts" as a value.
#Then create three new variables, and assign them values 
#by slicing the A) first 4 characters B) the last 
#4 characters and C) the entire string 
#backwards as given values.

var = "desserts"
var2 = var[0:4]
var3 = var[4:8]
var4 = var[::-1]

print("The first 4 characters were: ", var2)
print("The last 4 characters were: ", var3)
print("The string backwards was: ", var4)
