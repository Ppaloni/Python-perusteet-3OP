#In this exercise the aim is to try out different datatypes. 
#Start by defining two variables, and assign the 
#first variable the float value 10.6411. 
#The second variable gets a string "Stringline!" as a value.
#Convert the first variable to an integer, 
#and multiply the variable with the string by 2. 

val = 10.6411
string = "Stringline!"

#Convert to int
val = int(val)
string = string * 2

print("Integer conversion cannot do roundings: ", val)
print("Multiplying strings also causes trouble: ", string)
