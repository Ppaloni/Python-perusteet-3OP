#The exercises of the third chapter, as well as the 
#third chapter itself, focus on the conditional if-structure. 
#In the first exercise the objective is to create a simple 
#if-structure. The program should first ask a number 
#from the user and save it to a variable. 
#Then if the number is even (possible to divide by 2), 
#the program should print the text "The given number was even.". 
#The best way to do this is to use the operator remainder.

num = int(input("Give a number: "))

if (num % 2) == 0:
	print("The given number was even.")
