#The last exercise in this chapter continues with 
#the exercise from the last chapter, the calculator. 
#In this exercise, expand the existing code by implementing 
#the following new features: (A) Calculator does not 
#automatically quit when the result is given, 
#allowing user to do new calculations. 
#The user has to select "6" in the menu to exit the program. 
#(B) The calculator shows the selected numbers in the main menu by printing "Current numbers:" and the user-given input. By selecting "5" in the calculator menu, 
#the user can change the given numbers.

print("Calculator")
