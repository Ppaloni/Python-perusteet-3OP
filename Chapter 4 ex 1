#The first exercise in the fourth chapter is a 
#basic while-iteration. The assignment is simple: 
#create a program which on each turn prints the round number. 
#Start by the round number 0 and make the iteration continue for four loops.

lap = 0
while lap < 5:
	print("This is lap ", lap)
	lap += 1
