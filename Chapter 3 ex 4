#In the fourth exercise the idea is to define an if-structure 
#which decides the action based on several inputs. 
#The program asks for two numbers. If both of the numbers 
#are even, the program prints "Both numbers are even." 
#If only one of the numbers is even, the program prints 
#"One of the numbers is even.". 
#Finally, if neither of the numbers is even, the program 
#prints "Both numbers are odd".
