#The third progam tests a for-iteration. In this program, 
#build a calculator, which asks the user for a number, and 
#calculates the sum of all positive numbers from 0 to the 
#usergiven input. If the user gives the number 4, 
#the program calculates the sum 0+1+2+3, if 7, 
#the calculation is 0+1+2+3+4+5+6. 
#Finally, the program produces an answer with the printout "The sum was:" and an answer.
