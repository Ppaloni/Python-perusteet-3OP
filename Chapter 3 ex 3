#The third exercise is to create a conditional structure 
#which prints a line depending on the given selection. 
#The program asks a number between 1 and 3, and based on the 
#number prints the following: 1 prints "You selected one.", 
#2 prints "You selected two." and 3 prints "You selected three."

num = int(input("Select a number (1-3): "))
if num == 3:
	print("You selected three.")
elif num == 2:
	print("You selected two.")
else:
	print("You selected one.")
