#The first exercise in the fifth chapther is a straightforward 
#file reading exercise. There is a file in the same 
#directory with the exercise source code called "facts.txt", 
#which has a long strip of text. 
#Create a program which reads the entire content of 
#the file and prints it on the screen with the text "Following was read from the file:".

handle = open("facts.txt","r")
filetext = handle.read()
print("Following was read from the file: ", filetext)
handle.close()
